remote authorizers may have useful context from user\'s permissions. So\nwith this changes, custom authorizers using remote and remote_json can return\nsome useful headers to be forward into the AuthenticationSession, meaning that\nthese headers will be passed to upstream services. For example, an user\ncontaining scopes/branches inside an organization profile has some level of\ndata addressed to him. In this case, the upstream service need to know that,\nand "filter" the data according to his "branch_id". The permission that is\ngiven to the user (and the remote authorizers manages) has a record of the\n"branch_id", for the following responses will be returned as status code 200\n(if granted) and containing a header like X-Branch-Id.
