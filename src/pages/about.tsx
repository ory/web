          Our mission is to provide a common access control, authorisation and identity infrastructure
          that manages IAM and the associated data created in cloud applications. We deliver
          the information and associated analytics to members in the network in
          accordance with data privacy and usage conventions. We embrace and
          practice open source software development. We base our work on
          existing and emerging open cloud standards. As developers, we will
          continue to advance the ways we engineer and design our products to help
          other developers succeed.
