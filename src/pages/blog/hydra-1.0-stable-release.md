We are very excited to announce the 1.0 release of
[ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra), the open source OpenID Connect
CertifiedÂ® certified OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect server that runs natively
everywhere: Kubernetes, Virtual Machines, Bare-Metal-Servers, Windows, IoT
devices.

ORY Hydra is available via [GitHub](https://github.com/ory/hydra),
[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/hydra/), [Helm](https://k8s.ory.sh/helm),
[Homebrew, Scoop, and many other common package managers](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/install).

This release concludes a year-long development process where maintainers and
adopters worked relentlessly on building the most resilient, efficient, and
easiest to integrate OpenID and OAuth 2.0 Server to date. We would like to thank
everyone at [Segment](https://segment.com/),
[Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/),
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com), and many
other companies for their invaluable feedback and trust in this open source
project.

As part of this release, we are pleased to announce that ORY Hydra has been
certified as an OpenID Provider by the
[OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/foundation/)! Certified profiles include:
Basic OP, Implicit OP, Hybrid OP, Config OP, Dynamic OP.

In the name of all the maintainers and contributors, we want to thank our
sponsors [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/),
[German Stock Exchange](https://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-de/),
[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/),
[Tulip Retail](https://tulip.com/), [AllMyFunds](https://allmyfunds.com.au/) and
everyone who helped financially with bringing this project forward.

### What's next?

There are many exciting things coming up. We are currently in the process of
applying to become a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/)
incubating project. There are also several plans of improving interoperability
with Kubernetes through Custom Resources and Custom Controllers. We are also
planning of implementing several up-and-coming specs such as the
[Financial-grade API](https://openid.net/wg/fapi/) proposals and the
[OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls/).
