### Checklist for publishing changes to our website

Prior to publishing changes to our live website at [ory.sh](https://ory.sh), it is important to work through this list with care and attention to the outlined points. 

**After** making sure that all criteria are met, a developer can be asked to review the proposed changes.

- [ ] **Cross reference [ory.sh](https://ory.sh) and the netlify deploy with each other, by comparing them in a side by side view. All following steps should happen in side by side comparison.**
  - this will make even subtle changes that are not intended more visible and easier to correct
  - the website works slighty different in mobile and desktop versions - **repeat all following steps for both mobile and desktop**

**Links**
  - [ ] Every link in the navigation, external and internal, needs to be checked to work as intended
  - [ ] Every link in the footer, external and internal, needs to be checked to work as intended
  - [ ] Every link across the entire website, external and internal, needs to be checked to work as intended
    - Note: that ORY's Documentation is not managed within this repository and thus its content is not susceptible to changes made within this repository.

**Functionality**
  - [ ] Does the navigation menu behave as intended?
  - [ ] Does the footer menu behave as intended?
  - [ ] Do modules that require **javascript** (e.g. code snippet, live stats, etc) work as intended?
